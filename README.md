# GitHub Actions Playground

This project demonstrates a simple API testing setup using Bun and mocked API endpoints. It's designed to showcase how to structure tests, use fixtures, and mock API responses in a TypeScript environment.  
Most of the code was generated by Cursor using the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model.

## Project Structure

- `index.ts`: Main server file that runs a simple Bun server.
- `index.test.ts`: Contains the main test suite demonstrating various API request scenarios.
- `api.fixture.ts`: Defines API endpoints, mock responses, and utility functions.
- `mockSetup.ts`: Sets up the mock fetch function for API testing.
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow for running tests.
- `happydom.ts`: Sets up the DOM environment for testing.
- `bunfig.toml`: Configuration file for Bun.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.

## Features

- Mocked API endpoints for testing without a real backend
- Simulated API request chains (GET, POST, DELETE)
- UUID generation for mock object IDs
- Use of Bun's test runner and assertions
- Separation of concerns: mock setup is isolated from test files
- Error handling for edge cases (e.g., empty names, non-existent IDs)

## Test Scenarios

The tests in `index.test.ts` demonstrate the following scenarios:

1. API E2E Test: Full lifecycle of object creation, retrieval, and deletion.
2. POST - empty name test: Handling of invalid input (empty name).
3. GET by ID - non-existent ID test: Handling of requests for non-existent resources.
4. DELETE by ID - non-existent ID test: Handling of deletion requests for non-existent resources.

## Running the Project

To run the server:

```bash
bun start
```

## Running Tests

To run the tests, make sure you have Bun installed, then run:

```bash
bun test
```

## Development

To extend this project:

1. Add new endpoints in `api.fixture.ts`
2. Implement new mock responses in `mockSetup.ts`
3. Write additional tests in `index.test.ts` or create new test files as needed

When creating new test files, remember to import and use the `setupMockFetch` and `teardownMockFetch` functions from `mockSetup.ts`.

## GitHub Actions

The project uses GitHub Actions to automatically run tests on push or pull request to the main branch. Check `.github/workflows/test.yml` for the workflow configuration.

## Dependencies

- Bun (for running TypeScript and tests)
- TypeScript
- figlet (for server welcome message)
- @happy-dom/global-registrator (for DOM environment in tests)
